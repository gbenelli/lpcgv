# LPC GV Template

The `.tex` file provided will help combine all applications into a single file while also creating an index for them.

Any Mac with `git` and `xelatex` should be able to compile this document as-is. To do so, open Terminal, navigate to your preferred folder and do:

    git clone https://github.com/orduna/lpcgv.git
    cd lpcgv/
    make

The resulting `.pdf` file will be the document you are looking for.

Then add the actual applications to their corresponding folders and edit the `.tex` file accordingly before compiling again.
